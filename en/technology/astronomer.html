            With the development of astronomy in China, it will further promote China's economic and social development and better serve the production and life of the broad masses of the people.
<br> Astronomy has always been a symbol of the strength and civilization of a country. China's astronomy has had a glorious past. China has the world's oldest and richest records of solar eclipses, comets and other astronomical phenomena, and exquisite ancient astronomical instruments such as turbidity instrument and simplified instrument.
<br> After the founding of New China, the Chinese astronomical community began to catch up with the world's advanced level. Especially with the reform and opening up, China's astronomy has ushered in a golden age of development.
<br> In the 21st century, China's astronomy has made remarkable achievements.

                        <p> (In addition) nowadays, human beings rely more on high technology, such as satellite technology, communication technology, long-distance transmission, oil transmission, navigation and positioning, which may be threatened by intense solar activity. Intense solar activity can interrupt short-wave communication, or the navigation and positioning can not be carried out correctly, and even lead to the failure of scientific satellites to work properly or even fall. </p>
                        <p> Therefore, in today's high-tech, the intense activity of the sun and the resulting disastrous weather should be one of the important natural disasters facing mankind. </p>

                        <p> The Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASSO) is a solar space exploration satellite program spontaneously proposed by the solar physics community in China. It will be the first time to simultaneously observe the solar all-solar vector magnetic field, solar flare high-energy radiation imaging and the near-heliospheric propagation of coronal mass ejection on a satellite. It will reveal the intrinsic physical mechanism of solar flare eruption and coronal mass ejection caused by the evolution of solar magnetic field, which will not only expand the field of human knowledge, but also have a serious impact. The space weather of human living environment provides the physical basis for forecasting. </p>

                <div popup-switch data-key="article1">
                    <p> In 1973, Ye Shuhua boldly proposed to develop very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technology in China. In January 1986, under the leadership of Ye Shuhua, the Shanghai Observatory completed the "Proposal for the Development of China's VLBI Network" and planned the outline of China's VLBI Network: the new Urumqi VLBI Station, the reconstruction of Kunming 10-meter antenna to VLBI Station, the upgrading of Shanghai VLBI Data Processing Center, etc. The proposal was recommended by the Astronomical Committee, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences agreed to set up a project, which was designated as a major project during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period of Tiankou. The project was named the second phase of the VLBI network project, and Ye Shuhua, the chief engineer of the project, was established. It is her unremitting efforts and strategic vision that made the Shanghai Observatory and the Chinese astronomy rapidly catch up with the trend of international astronomy from classical observation to space observation in the 1980s and 1990s. People who have worked with Ye Shuhua say that her eyes are always far away, but she says, "Opportunity is right in front of you. How can we not seize it?" </p>
                </div>
                <h3 popup-switch data-key="title2">Time, Time</h3>
                <div popup-switch data-key="article2">
                    <p> Where was the earliest Beijing Time we used every day? The world's two most precise time systems, one in France, consisting of 39 observatories, and the other in the former Soviet Union, supported by 17 observatories. But the astronomical observatories that we could use at that time were not enough for other people's spare parts. The Zijin Mountain in Nanjing and Xujiahui in Shanghai were all. </p>
<p> Ye Shuhua led the team to test and calibrate repeatedly to overcome the difficult problem of mathematical model. He added astronomical time to the National Astronomical institutes for six years and established the world time of independent measurement in China. Popularly speaking, the Beijing time we use today is the result of the calibration of Ye Shuhua's team at that time. </p>
<p> This year, at the age of 32, she led China to rank second in the world in the accuracy of world time measurement. Years later, she became the director of the Observatory. She was invited to France for exchange. On her parting, foreign colleagues toasted her: "Cheers to the director of the Observatory." </p>
