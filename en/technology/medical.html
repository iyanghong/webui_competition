                        <p> In the 1960s, Tu Yongyou, 39, was appointed by state leaders and began to devote himself to the research and development of prescriptions for malaria treatment. At that time, the world suffered from malaria, a highly infectious disease that has been a nightmare threatening human life and security for thousands of years. Domestic conditions are difficult, with old equipment, can we make a miracle? Faced with everyone's queries, Tu Youyou firmly said: "No, no, no, no, only the problem of reluctance to insist." </p>
                        <p> With the belief of scientific research, Tu Youyou expressed his willingness to sacrifice all personal interests. Keep moving forward in one test. Whether the test results are good or bad, the only way out is to keep trying and refining. Later, Tu Youyou was inspired by Chinese ancient books. She found a sentence in "The Emergency Prescription for Elbow Reserve": "Once you hold the Artemisia artemisiae, take the juice with two liters of water, and take it as much as you can." Originally, as early as the Eastern Jin Dynasty in 400 AD, Artemisia annua was used to deal with malaria. So she began to follow this line of thinking down, in a critical situation, even at the cost of testing drugs. Finally, artemisinin was discovered, bringing a new antimalarial drug to the world. </p>

                        <p> Tu Youyou is not an academician, a doctor or a foreign student. She is known as "Three Scientists Without Scientists". But even so, she can achieve world-class achievements. </p>
<p> Like all new drugs, Tu's team has to spend more time improving the drug before it can eventually spread artemisinin around the world. Artemisinin was listed in the list of "essential drugs" in 1999. Malaria has been saved since then. But Tu Youyou still worked in silence until 2015, when she was discovered around the world and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. We did not know Tu Youyou until we discovered a new treatment for malaria with artemisinin. Because of her and her team, millions of lives have been saved in malaria-stricken Africa! </p>
<p> As we can see from the enterprise survey, in fact, the related artemisinin therapeutic drugs applied for the patent as early as 1997, but it was more than ten years late for us to know Tu Youyou. </p>

                        <p> Tu Youyou believes that in order to solve the problem of "artemisinin resistance", it is necessary to understand the mechanism of artemisinin. Wang Jigang, a member of Tu Youyou's team and a researcher at the Artemisinin Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said that the half-life of artemisinin in the human body (the time required for a drug to halve its concentration in the organism) was very short, ranging from 1 to 2 hours, while the recommended course of artemisinin combination therapy was three days, and that artemisinin was a truly efficient insecticidal window. The mouth is limited to 4 to 8 hours. The existing drug-resistant strains take full advantage of the short half-life of artemisinin to change their life cycle or temporarily enter a dormant state in order to avoid sensitive insecticidal period. At the same time, malaria parasites can also produce obvious resistance to the adjuvant drug "antimalarial prescription" in artemisinin combination therapy, which makes artemisinin combination therapy "ineffective". </p>
                        <p> After more than three years of scientific research, Tu Youyou's team has made new breakthroughs in the aspects of "research on the mechanism of anti-malaria", "causes of drug resistance" and "adjustment of treatment methods", and proposed new treatment countermeasures: first, to extend the medication time appropriately, from three-day therapy to five-day or seven-day therapy; second, to replace the artemisinin combination therapy has already been used. An adjuvant drug that produces drug resistance has an immediate effect. </p>
