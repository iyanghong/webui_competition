                    <p> Yuan Longping is the pioneer and leader in the field of hybrid rice research. He devotes himself to the research of hybrid rice. He has successively developed three-line hybrid rice, two-line hybrid rice and super hybrid rice in the first and second stages. At the same time, Yuan Longping put forward and implemented the project of "three-yield and four-yield" by using super rice. Technical achievements of hybrid rice have been published in 6 Monographs in Chinese and English, and more than 60 papers have been published. </p>
<p> In July 2017, he was appointed Chief Professor of Qingdao Seawater Rice Institute. </p>
<p> In September 2017, Yuan Longping announced a new achievement in removing heavy metal cadmium from rice. </p>
<p> On April 14, 2018, Yuan Longping expressed his views on GM in an interview with Phoenix Finance and Economics in Hainan. For GM soybeans, Yuan Longping pointed out that as long as GM crops passed the safety test, there would be no problem. </p>
<p> Yuan Longping said that genetically modified agriculture is the future direction of development. </p>

                    <p> He planted hybrid rice in deserts and saline-alkali lands, Africa and the world. He once said that if the research on seawater rice was successful, it would increase the country's arable land by at least 100 million mu and feed 100 million more people, and increase production by 2 tons per hectare and feed 500 million more people. He has two dreams: a dream of enjoying the cool under the grass and a dream of covering the whole world. At the age of 90, he is still busy with his dreams. </p>
                    <p> Even though he has already passed the retirement age and is about to reach the age of 90, Yuan Longping, a famous hybrid rice expert, insists on working in his office. Since leaving his post as director of the National Hybrid Rice Engineering Research Center in 2015, he is now a researcher of the Center and continues to direct the research of hybrid rice. </p>

                <p> In 1934, Tan Jiazhen went to California Institute of Technology to pursue his doctorate. He entered the famous Morgan Laboratory at that time, and was taught by Morgan, the founder of genetics. </p>
<p> With Morgan's support, he participated in the project of chromosome genetic mapping. In more than two years in the laboratory, he used the latest research results of Drosophila salivary gland chromosomes to analyze the structure and variation of Drosophila in intraspecific and interspecific, and to explore the relationship between different species, thus deepening the understanding of the evolutionary mechanism. In 1936, Tan Jiazhen's doctoral dissertation "Autosomal genetic map of Drosophila melanogaster" passed the defense and was widely appreciated by Morgan and other tutors and classmates, winning honor for the Chinese scientific community. </p>
<p> In the summer of 1937, with a childlike heart, Tan Jiazhen abandoned all kinds of preferential treatment abroad and earnestly retained Morgan Laboratory, which he continued to study. He resolutely chose to return to his motherland and dedicated his life to the genetics of his motherland. Tan Jiazhen has been engaged in the teaching and research of genetics for more than 70 years. He has published more than 100 research papers and academic articles. His research work mainly involves the cellular inheritance, population inheritance, radiation inheritance, toxicological inheritance, molecular inheritance and genetic engineering of ladybugs, fruit flies, rhesus monkeys, human beings and plants. Especially in the field of population evolution of Drosophila melanogaster and genetic variation of color spot of Ladybug heterochromatosus, pioneering achievements have been made, which provide important evidence for the establishment of modern comprehensive evolutionary theory. </p>
<p> He discovered the mosaic dominance of Ladybug stain inheritance, which aroused tremendous repercussions in the international genetics circle and was regarded as a great contribution to the development of classical genetics. Mr. Tan Jiazhen insisted on scientific truth and devoted his whole life to the cause of genetics. He has trained a large number of outstanding talents for genetics research, established the first genetics specialty in China, established the first genetics research institute, established the first Academy of life sciences, and made outstanding contributions to the national genetics education cause. </p>
