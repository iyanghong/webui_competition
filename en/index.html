His main research fields are radio astrophysics and radio astronomy technology and methods. He is responsible for the scientific and technological work of the 500-meter spherical radio telescope (FAST), a major national scientific and technological infrastructure. May 2017, won the National Innovation Competition Award.The 500-meter spherical radio telescope (FAST), known as the "Chinese Eye of the Sky", has realized many observation modes such as tracking, drift scanning and in-motion scanning after two years of intensive debugging. As the initiator and founder of this project, Nan Rendong is honored as "Father of the Eye of Heaven". From promoting China's participation in the construction of a new generation of radio telescopes to advocating China's autonomous construction of the largest and most sensitive radio telescopes, Nan Rendong resolutely abandoned the favorable conditions and salaries for scientific research abroad and returned home to preside over the telescope pre-research.

He led the research and design of nuclear weapons theory for a long time and solved a large number of theoretical problems.

Since the 1970s, he has played an important role in advocating and promoting the research of several high-tech projects. Yu Min's name was once top secret.

                                <p>Yuan Longping is the pioneer and leader in the field of hybrid rice research. He devotes himself to the research of hybrid rice. He has successively developed three-line hybrid rice, two-line hybrid rice and super hybrid rice in the first and second stages. At the same time, Yuan Longping put forward and implemented the project of "three-yield and four-high-yield" by using super hybrid rice. He has published 6 Monographs in Chinese and English and more than 60 papers. He planted hybrid rice in deserts and saline-alkali lands, Africa and the world. He once said that if the research on seawater rice was successful, it would increase the country's arable land by at least 100 million mu and feed 100 million more people, and increase production by 2 tons per hectare and feed 500 million more people. He has two dreams: a dream of enjoying the cool under the grass and a dream of covering the whole world. At the age of 90, he is still busy with his dreams.

                                <p>With the belief of scientific research, Tu Youyou expressed his willingness to sacrifice all personal interests. Keep moving forward in one test. Whether the test results are good or bad, the only way out is to keep trying and refining. Later, Tu Youyou was inspired by Chinese ancient books. She found a sentence in "The Emergency Prescription for Elbow Reserve": "Once you hold the Artemisia artemisiae, take the juice with two liters of water, and take it as much as you can." Originally, as early as the Eastern Jin Dynasty in 400 AD, Artemisia annua was used to deal with malaria. So she began to follow this line of thinking down, in a critical situation, even at the cost of testing drugs. Finally, artemisinin was discovered, bringing a new antimalarial drug to the world.

However, for many reasons, Ma Yun decided to abandon these businesses in Beijing at the beginning of 1999.

                                <p>Under the advocacy and promotion of Chen Jinhua, in March 2008, 36 female teachers in the school paired with 58 left-behind and poor children, and gave their team a warm and loving name: "Teacher's mother". At the beginning of 2009, Chen Jinhua, who had heard and witnessed that female teachers cared for the "children" of Left-behind children, applied voluntarily to become the first male "teacher mother" in the school. Chen Jinhua, 56, has been teaching in rural schools for 35 years and is the vice principal of Taizhou Experimental Primary School. Ten years ago, the five-foot-tall man, along with his colleagues, had an unusual identity: "Teacher's mother".
                                        Since then, Chen Jinhua and the left-behind children have formed an inseparable bond, like the treatment of biological children, meticulously care for the growth of these "children"; just like the treatment of career, he has devoted himself to promoting the work of caring for the left-behind children, and wrote down the ordinary and extraordinary teaching of a rural teacher with full of "love".

                                <p>Wang Wuhui was deeply influenced by his uncle, who was also a doctor. He loved medicine and studied medicine with his uncle. He went back to the countryside after Maoming's further study. Doctor's profession is a "fragrant baboon" wherever it is. Wang Wuhui hesitated to go to the city for employment, but when he saw the poor villagers'difficulty in seeing a doctor, he couldn't bear it, so he stayed in the village.
                                        Wang Wuhui is very busy every day, less than 80 square meters of the clinic, from the doctor, dispensing, injection are operated by him alone. With the idea of "doctor's parents'heart", he listened patiently to the patient's state of illness. Every patient should be observed and cared for meticulously in the work, and medication should be taken cautiously. Whether it was cold or hot, during the day or at night, he did his duty, often tossing and turning all night without sleeping. Sometimes when a patient comes to the door just after he starts his job at home, he will put down his chopsticks to see the doctor first. Even at the beginning of the new year, he has not asked for leave, let alone the usual weekend.</p>

                                        That is to say, seeking truth from facts means starting from reality, integrating theory with practice, and combining the general principles of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of China. The mass line means that everything is for the masses, everything depends on them, comes from the masses and goes to the masses. Independence and self-reliance means proceeding from China's reality and relying on the masses for revolution and construction. Mao Zedong Thought is the precious spiritual wealth of our Party, which will guide our Party's action for a long time.
