                            <p> As early as 1930, he opposed this doctrine, emphasizing that investigation and research are the first step in all work, and that without investigation, there would be no right to speak. </p>

In view of the "cruel struggle" and "merciless strike" left-leaning errors in the inner-Party struggle in history, he put forward the correct policy of "punishing the former and killing the latter, curing the sick and saving the people", emphasizing that in the inner-party struggle, we should not only clarify our thoughts but also unite our comrades. He created a rectification form of Marxist-Leninist ideological education through criticism and self-criticism throughout the Party.
