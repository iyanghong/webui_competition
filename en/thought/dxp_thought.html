                            Emphasis should be placed on following our own path, not regarding books as dogmas, not copying foreign models, taking Marxism as guidance, taking practice as the sole criterion for testing truth, emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, respecting the initiative spirit of the masses, and building socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

                            It points out that the essence of socialism is to liberate productive forces, develop productive forces, eliminate exploitation, eliminate polarization and ultimately achieve common prosperity. It is emphasized that the main contradiction in our society at the present stage is the contradiction between the increasing material and cultural needs of the people and the backward social production. We must put the development of productive forces in the first place, take economic construction as the center, and promote social progress in an all-round way.

It is emphasized that opening to the outside world is indispensable for reform and construction, and that closure can only lead to backwardness.</p>

These four basic principles are the foundation of a nation, the guarantee of the healthy development of reform, opening up and modernization, and the new era content of reform, opening up and modernization.

                           The creative conception of "one country, two systems" is put forward.

                            It is proposed that modernization should be basically realized in three steps. In the long process of modernization construction, we should seize the opportunity to strive for a number of stages of rapid development and better benefits, and to reach a higher level every few years. Poverty is not socialism, and it is impossible to get rich at the same time. We must allow and encourage some people in some areas to get rich first, so as to drive more and more regions and people to achieve common prosperity gradually.
