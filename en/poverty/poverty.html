                <p>动员大户带头试种高效品种,联系大户上门收购,动员村民上网销售……他说,脱贫路漫漫,更需要信心满满;帮欠薪村民联系法律援助,为村文艺队邀请正规老师开展培训、传承“太阳古歌”,为当地配套民族文化产业注册商标和域名。他说,做好一件件小事,才能和民族群众一起“唱着歌,把贫脱”。</p>

                    <p class="panel_en">Baini village in Shishan is a deeply impoverished village. There are 195
                        impoverished households in 472 households in the village. Eleven natural villages are scattered.
                        The farthest one is 13 kilometers away from the village, and several of them are more than 10
                        kilometers away. When he first arrived in the village, Huang Wenxiu met a nail.</p>
                    <p class="panel_en">In order to gain the trust of the masses, we must treat them as relatives from
                        the heart, urgently think about what they want, and truly integrate with them. Huang Wenxiu
                        learned the truth by consulting his colleagues with experience in the village and the old branch
                        books in the village. Soon she changed her working methods, and instead of asking questions in
                        books, she took off her coat and helped clean the yard to do farm work. When the poor families
                        were not at home, she went to the fields to help them pick sugar oranges, grow oil tea, and work
                        at the same time, talking about the family routine; she did not speak Mandarin, but learned to
                        speak dialect...</p>
                    <p class="panel_en"> Huang Wenxiu often did not go home at weekends. He visited all the poor
                        households in the village. He also drew the "distribution map of the poor households" in the
                        village. The address, family situation and causes of poverty of each household were marked in
                        his notebook one by one. From the beginning of accepting Huang Wenxiu, the masses loved and
                        respected her in their hearts. Some people joked, "You're such a tough girl to get entangled
                        with!"</p>
                    <p class="panel_en">Huang Wenxiu once said to his friends, "In the Long March, soldiers are not
                        afraid of death. How can this difficulty limit my progress on the road to poverty alleviation?"
                        "As the first secretary stationed in the village, he will never win a victory, and never take
                        troops!"</p>

                        than ten kilometers every day for work. On the way, when I meet the villagers, I always greet
                        Luo Tuo warmly and take her along on my own initiative. There are 88 poor households in the
                        village, and the specific conditions of each household are different. Luo Tsuo is very clear
                        about the 173 Poverty Alleviation Policies of the state, who needs help from the furniture body,
                        the children going to school, the elderly seeing a doctor, the housing improvement and so on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="panel_en">The Rosandandandanda family in the village is the most reassuring one in Luotuo.
                        The house was cracked and Rosandandandanda's wife and eldest daughter were sick all the year
                        round. Considering the specific situation of Rosandandanda's family, Lotso suggested that
                        Rosandanda move to a centralized settlement, so that Rosandanda and his family can not only have
                        free housing, but also have more convenient medical treatment and employment. But the Rosandanas
                        could not give up the land they had planted for half their lives. They were always reluctant to
                        accept Lotso's proposal for relocation and refused countless times. She did not give up easily
                        and painstakingly contacted the tenants who were willing to contract for the land of
                        Rosandandanda family. She took Rosandanda to the resettlement site to experience the environment
                        here personally. With Lotso's continuous efforts, the Rosandandanda family was finally
                        persuaded. Rosandandandanda, who relocated to the resettlement site, said happily, "It's very
                        good and beautiful. Now I'm very happy to see it. The quality of the house is good. Anyway,
                        everything is good. I want to thank the Party and the government."</p>

                    <p class="panel_en">The Wachang village of Gongchenyu poverty alleviation is a multi-ethnic
                        administrative village composed of Zhuang, Miao, Han and Yi nationalities. It is located in the
                        rocky desertification area of southern Yunnan. There are less than 1 800 people in the village,
                        but more than one third of the poor people.</p>
                    <p class="panel_en">In September 2017, Gong Chenyu learned that he had spent most of his savings
                        because of the death of his elderly family. Although the local civil affairs department had sent
                        him relief food, his daughter's pressure to study and the cost of restoring production at home
                        kept him frowning all day. With Gong Chenyu's help, a loving person from Beijing took the
                        initiative to form a "help couple" with his family, offering to pay for all the study expenses
                        his daughter needed until she graduated from university, and transferred 2,000 yuan to his
                        family through Wechat. "One village has one village. It's really not easy to get rid of poverty
                        in Wachang village." Gong Chenyu was no longer in such a hurry when he entered the village for
                        more than four months.</p>
                    <p class="panel_en">Mobilize big households to take the lead in trying out high-efficiency
                        varieties, contact big households to buy on their doors, and mobilize villagers to sell
                        online... He said that poverty alleviation has a long way to go, and more confidence is needed;
                        to help the unpaid villagers contact legal aid, invite regular teachers for the village literary
                        and art team to carry out training, inherit the "Sun Ancient Song", and register trademarks and
                        domain names for the local supporting national cultural industries. He said that only by doing a

                    <p data-animation="fadeInLeft">"The road into the village is still a long mud road, clear and rainy.
                        Six natural villages have not yet hardened their roads to villages, five Miao villages are
                        seriously short of water, and some of the poor people still live a life of inseparability
                        between human beings and livestock. This is Qin Xining's first impression of Gedang Village. On
                        January 13, 2016, Qin Xining, a cadre of the International Cooperation Bureau of the Supreme
                        People's Procuratorate, came to Gedang Village, Xinhua Town, Funing County, Yunnan Province, to
                        serve as the first Secretary of poverty alleviation in the village, shouldering the important
                        task of fighting poverty in Gedang Village. That year, when he was 29 years old, his first
                        birthday gift was a hand-painted "battle map" of the geographical distribution of 13 natural
                        villages in Gedang Village. Qin Xining started from visiting 88 filing and card-making
                        households in 13 villages under the jurisdiction of Gedang Village, and went deep into the
                        villagers'homes to have a heart-to-heart talk with them to understand the villagers' income and
                        expenditure situation and difficulties at home.</p>
                    <p data-animation="fadeInLeft"> The eyes of the masses are bright, calm and quiet. The common people
                        will naturally realize that you are not coming to"play soy sauce"or"come and read". What's more,
                        it's not so-called"come and gild". It's doing things for them. Qin Xining said. Only through
                        household survey, can not fully understand the difficulties of families. Qin Xining believes
                        that the situation should be understood in many ways. As a result, he changed his work strategy
                        and took lessons from village cadres as soon as he had time, and talked to the villagers more
                        about his family life, so as to carry out the precise poverty alleviation work more pertinently.
                    </p>
                    <p data-animation="fadeInLeft">Once, Wang Yi, an old branch of the village committee, responded to
                        Qin Xining's response that "the people's hopes for the mud road to repair the village entrance
                        are all white." In a twinkling of an eye, Gedang Village completed the paving and opening of the
                        oil road from 323 National Highway to 10 kilometers of the village committee's location,
                        hardening the road into a group of 5.3 kilometers.</p>
