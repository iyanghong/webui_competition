                    <p> Before returning home, Ma Yun went to Seattle to see a friend, where Ma Yun first contacted the Internet. The Spanish newspaper El Pais vividly described Ma Yun's mood at that time - "I was even afraid to touch the keys of the computer. I thought: Who knows how much it costs? If I break it, I'll pay for it." </p>
                    <p> What touched Ma Yun was that he curiously said to his friends that he typed the word "beer" into the search engine, only to find American and German brands. At that time, he thought that he should use the Internet to help Chinese companies become familiar with the world. </p>
                    <p> In this way, Ma Yun, one of the top ten outstanding young teachers in Hangzhou, resigned and borrowed $2,000. In April 1995, he set up "China Yellow Page", one of the first Internet companies in China. At the end of 1997, Ma Yun and his team developed a series of government websites in Beijing, such as the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the online China Commodity Exchange Market. However, for many reasons, Ma Yun decided to abandon these businesses in Beijing at the beginning of 1999. He refused Yahoo and Sina's high-paying invitation and decided to return to Hangzhou to establish an e-commerce site that could serve small and medium-sized enterprises all over the world. </p>

                                <p> From my grandmother to my son, they all read Alibaba. So Ma Yun bought the Alibaba domain name from someone else. Alibaba's founding meeting was arranged at Ma Yun's house --- of course, nobody would have thought that a few years later, they could eat the famous Yahoo China. </p>
                                <p> Eighteen entrepreneurs raised 500,000 yuan of capital on the premise that they did not borrow money from relatives and friends. These include Ma Yun's wife, colleagues and students when he was a teacher, friends in need, and, of course, industry elites attracted by his personality charm, such as Cai Chongxin, Chief Financial Officer of Alibaba, who abandoned the position of Vice President of an investment company with an annual salary of $750,000 to receive Ma Yun's salary of several hundred yuan. </p>
                                <p> Ma Yun ordered that every employee rent the house within five minutes of his home. At that time, the work was day and night, and the happiest time was when Ma Yun personally cooked for everyone and served a good dish. </p>

                                <p> In 2000, Ma Yun received $25 million from venture capital companies, and in 2004 he raised $82 million from Softbank. Then he spent RMB 100 million on Taobao in one year. The latest figure is a billion dollars investment from Yahoo. </p>
                                <p> At a news conference on Alibaba's cooperation with Yahoo on August 11, Ma Yun was the absolute star, the focus of the spotlight, despite the presence of Yahoo CEO Daniel Rosenger. A Reuters photographer, even in order to take a picture of Ma Yun, was so rude that he had to be persuaded by the security guards at last. This was an episode at the conference site, and the Ma Yun effect was evident. </p>
                                <p> Ma Yun ingeniously used a specific time to unveil a highly sensational event: "Today is Chinese Valentine's Day, Alibaba and Yahoo's seven-year fate can be combined today." </p>
                                <p> He sat there and talked, smiling all the time on his childlike face, without too much excitement or generosity, but only the stability and calmness of the overall situation. "Alibaba has acquired all the assets of Yahoo China, including Yahoo's portal, Yahoo's Search, Yahoo's IM (instant messaging), 3721, including all Yahoo's assets in one photo online. This behavior is very exciting for Alibaba. </p>
