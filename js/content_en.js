Among the various synthetic schemes considered, the simplest one is to synthesize A and B chains separately, and then to combine the two chains correctly through the oxidation of mercapto groups. But the key question is whether the reduced A and B chains can form natural insulin molecules through oxidation. Many attempts made by foreign countries have failed. Except for small peptides like oxytocin, there was no protein containing disulfide bond that could be successfully regenerated by oxidation after reduction. This precondition for determining the synthetic route is precisely an unprecedented unknown problem. Successful insulin disassembly immediately determined the synthetic route of first synthesizing A and B chains respectively, then combining A and B chains to produce active insulin, which made an important contribution to the completion of the first international artificial synthesis of protein-insulin. </p>",

He suffered from hunger and was well aware of the value and importance of grain. Therefore, in addition to wheat scientific research, Li Zhensheng also pays great attention to China's grain production, actively carries out strategic research on agricultural development, and puts forward scientific suggestions for agricultural production. In 1987, Li Zhensheng, who had worked in Northwest China for 31 years, was transferred back to Beijing as Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Shortly after taking office, Li Zhensheng put forward the suggestion of middle and low yield field management in Huanghuaihai region. At that time, China's food production had been hovering for three years since 1984, and the food production had not increased in three years, while the population had increased by more than 50 million. The government is anxious to find a solution to break the lingering situation. Li Zhensheng predicted the potential of 50 billion jin in Huang-Huai-Hai area through three months'investigation, and put forward the management plan of middle and low yield fields in Huang-Huai-Hai area. With the full impetus of President Zhou Guangzhao, more than 400 scientists and technicians from 25 research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences went deep into the Huang-Huai-Hai region and cooperated with local scientists and technicians to carry out a large-scale management of low-and medium-yield fields, playing a leading role. Facts have proved that this prediction is correct. When China's grain increased from 800 billion kg to 900 billion kg, the growth of the Huang-Huai-Hai region was 504.8 billion kg. </p><p> In April 2005, at the Boao Forum, Li Zhensheng used a lot of scientific data to answer Lester Brown's book \"Who will feed China\" ten years ago. 》 The best seller responded. Li Zhensheng collected the relevant data of China in the past 15 years and compared it with Brown's prediction. It was found that Brown's three inferences were incorrect and did not accord with China's reality. First, the population growth rate is 1/3 slower than he predicted. Brown predicts that the average annual population growth in the next 40 years will be 12 million, while the real population growth in 2003 will be only 7.61 million. Secondly, the per capita arable land reduction rate is not as serious as Brown predicted, because the area of arable land measured by remote sensing in China is 36.9% more than the original published traditional figures. Thirdly, China's total grain imports and exports in the past 15 years are basically flat, with net imports of only 87.94 billion jin, equivalent to 0.6% of total consumption, which is insignificant. </p><p> Li Zhensheng believes that we should tell the world these facts and that Chinese people can feed themselves! Now, in the future, we believe that with China's correct policies, scientific, technological and economic development, we will be able to support ourselves. </p>"

He handed some French and English site selection documents back to young people like Li Qibin and Li Jing, and led them around Beijing in site selection according to international standards. The plan for the construction of an observatory in Beijing began in 1956 with the \"Twelve-Year Plan for the Development of Science and Technology 1956-1967\". Until October 1964, Lianyingzhai, Xinglong County, Hebei Province, was finally selected to build the optical observation base of the Beijing Observatory. At present, it is still the most important optical observation base of Astrophysics in China. The most important aspect of Cheng Maolan's astronomical research is the detailed study of the spectrum of stars. Since stars are very remote and dim, and spectral studies have to expand the energy gathered by telescopes along wavelength, spectral studies were limited to the low sensitivity of photographic negatives before the 1950s, and only a few bright stars could be studied. Cheng Maolan focused his research on some special variables."

Together with Theodore von Carmen, he proposed the spectral theory of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, which has an important influence on the development of early statistical theory of turbulence. Since the 1960s, Lin Jiaqiao has entered the field of astrophysics research, founded the density wave theory of Galaxy spiral structure, successfully explained the main characteristics of discoid Galaxy spiral structure, confirmed that the observed spiral arm is wave rather than material arm, overcome the \"entanglement problem\" that has puzzled astronomy for decades, and then went on to explain the main characteristics of discoid Galaxy spiral structure. The dynamic theory of long-term maintenance of galactic spiral arms has been developed. Since 1972, Lin Jiaqiao has made many academic visits to China, invited many well-known American experts to give lectures in China, accepted many scholars to study at MIT, trained a number of accomplished scholars for China, promoted the development of many new fields of Applied Mathematics and fluid mechanics in China, and promoted the development of China's scientific and technological undertakings.

Compound sulfathiazole is used locally in gynecology and vagina, initially in the form of powder. When taking medicine, patients need to go to the hospital, which is administered by nurses. Both patients and nurses feel inconvenience. After that, the drug was converted into tablets, which were easy to use if vaginal secretions were more, but when secretions were reduced, the whole tablet fell out, so it could not play a therapeutic role. </p><p> for this reason, Chen Lanying intends to transform it into a bubble film.

In 1984, the first clinical pharmacy course of Peking Union Medical College Hospital was finally opened. In 1985, she was invited to visit the United States. After returning to China, he worked with his colleagues to actively tap the potential, sum up experience and continue to run four clinical pharmacy courses. In addition to teaching in her own country, she has invited more than a dozen American professors to give lectures in China. The trainees were also expanded from pharmacists of our hospital to hospital pharmacists of 23 provinces, cities and regions in China. </p>",

A Chinese company contracting construction projects with American businessmen hired Ma Yun to collect accounts for translators in the United States. The next thing is like what happened in Hollywood movies: American businessmen want to default, pull out a gun and confine Ma Yun in his room for two days. Ma Yun was released in panic, lost his carry-on luggage and had to earn $600 at a Las Vegas casino to return home. Before returning home, Ma Yun went to Seattle to see a friend, where Ma Yun first contacted the Internet. The Spanish newspaper El Pais vividly described Ma Yun's mood at that time - \"I was even afraid to touch the keys of the computer. I thought: Who knows how much it costs? If I break it, I'll pay for it.\" What touched Ma Yun was that he curiously said to his friends that he typed the word \"beer\" into the search engine, only to find American and German brands. At that time, he thought that he should use the Internet to help Chinese companies become familiar with the world. In this way, Ma Yun, one of the top ten outstanding young teachers in Hangzhou, resigned and borrowed $2,000. In April 1995, he opened \"China Yellow Page\", one of the first Internet companies in China. At the end of 1997, Ma Yun and his team developed a series of government websites in Beijing, such as the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the online China Commodity Exchange Market. However, for many reasons, Ma Yun decided to abandon these businesses in Beijing at the beginning of 1999. He refused Yahoo and Sina's high-paying invitation and decided to return to Hangzhou to establish an e-commerce site that could serve small and medium-sized enterprises all over the world. </p>",
